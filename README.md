Having worked in accounts for 2+ years and dabbling with Excel VBA scripts I thought it was time to get serious. Being able to create a project from scratch and see it come to life is why becoming a developer appealed to me. With this in mind I started studying with Makers Academy in September 2018, learning the fundamentals of becoming a software developer.

Throughout the Makers Academy course I've taken on lots of different challenging projects, learnt best coding practices and continually worked on my self development. The next logical step to continue this journey is to join an inventive team of developers where I can begin to use these skills in a productive environment and push myself even further.

## Skills

#### Initiative

Whilst working as an accounts assistant many tasks performed were done manually on Excel. I knew there had to be a better way which was how I discovered Excel's programming language VBA. Starting off with some very humble ```for``` loops I taught myself to use this language, quickly reducing the time spent on long processes and increasing the efficiency of the office dramatically.

#### Analytical thinker

In my previous role I produced month end accounts and analysed the data from these reports to communicate to clients about the position of their business and generate plans for growth. This needed a high attention to detail and an ability to quickly understand how pieces of data linked together.

#### Fast Learner

I'm able to pick up new languages, technologies and ideas very quickly. My final project was building a neural network, a concept completely new to me. This was done in just 2 weeks using Python and the TensorFlow package with no prior experience of either.
